      <h2>Building a Secure, Scalable Cybersecurity Training Platform</h2>
      <p>A digital environment that educates, protects, and evolves</p>

      <h2>Project Overview: Cybersecurity Training Portal</h2>
      <p>
        This project focuses on building a cybersecurity training website designed for employees in medium to large companies. The goal is to help people avoid common digital risks—like phishing emails or using weak passwords—through short, interactive lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each employee gets a personalized learning path based on their department. IT might learn about firewall basics, while HR gets training on spotting social engineering. It’s meant to be quick, useful, and secure. Progress is tracked, quizzes are included, and reminders keep learners on track.
      </p>

      <h2>Systems Design, Engineering & Organization</h2>
      <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*c0EHwU_Zr_g46oBfbGl2fQ.png" alt="System design diagram" />
      <p>
        Systems design is about how everything behind the scenes works together—like the engine inside a car. It includes how data flows, how code is organized, and how teams manage it all.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this training platform, services are broken into smaller parts: one handles logins, another delivers content, another tracks analytics. This makes updates easier and reduces the risk of the whole site crashing.
      <p>
        The Cybersecurity Training Platform also uses monitoring tools to track what’s working and what’s not. This helps the the DevOps team fix the problems early. The system is built with future growth in mind so we can add more content or support more users without slowing down.
      </p>

    <section id="content" class="section">
      <h2>Content & Information Architecture</h2>
      <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240711125152/Information-Architecture-(1).webp" alt="Information architecture illustration" />
      <p>
        Information architecture is how the content is organized and labeled so people can find what they need without getting lost. It’s like having a well-organized library with signs and clear labels.
      </p>
      <p>
        The site’s training modules are grouped by topic, difficulty, and role. So a beginner in HR sees different content than an advanced IT user. Tags, search tools, and filters help users find lessons fast.
      </p>
      <p>
        All key actions, like starting a course, checking scores, or resuming training—are easy to access. This keeps users focused on learning instead of figuring out how to use the site. We also remove old content regularly so the platform always feels fresh and relevant.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="ux" class="section">
      <h2>User Experience & Visual Design</h2>
      <img src="https://www.sketchappsources.com/resources/source-image/UIFrames.png" alt="UX wireframe sketch" />
      <p>
        User Experience (UX) is how the site feels to use. Visual design is how it looks. Together, they make sure users have a smooth, pleasant experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        This training platform uses a clean layout, easy-to-read fonts, and buttons that work well on both desktop and mobile. First-time users can log in and begin learning within seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        The also follow accessibility practices: ike using high-contrast colors for visibility and touch-friendly design. Before launching new features, we ask real users to try them and give feedback to help us improve.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="security" class="section">
      <h2>Security & Ethics</h2>
      <img src="https://img.freepik.com/free-vector/lock-shield-cyber-security-technology-blue-tone_53876-119533.jpg?semt=ais_hybrid&w=740" alt="Security shield graphic" />
      <p>
        Security and ethics make sure users are protected and treated fairly. It’s about doing what’s right, not just what’s legal.
      </p>
      <p>
        The platform uses secure logins, encrypted data, and smart rules about what can be seen or shared. only collect what’s needed to improve learning. Nothing extra. All data is deleted after a set time, and users know what’s being tracked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before we add any new feature, we ask: “Would users be okay with this?” If the answer isn’t a clear yes, we don’t add it. Trust is part of the product.
      </p>
