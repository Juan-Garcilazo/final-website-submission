        <h3>Multnomah Falls</h3>
        <p>Multnomah Falls is a waterfall on Multnomah Creek in Oregon's Columbia River Gorge, east of Troutdale and between Corbett and Dodson. The waterfall is accessible via the Historic Columbia River Highway and Interstate 84. When I first arrived I was met with the dewey scent of fresh moss, cold water, and fresh air. Depending on where you park your vehicle, you'll walk inside a tunnel that opens up to a small creek/river. But when you look up you'll hear a faint roar, and crackle. As you make your way toward the paved road, you'll be greeted with a tourish shop, a coffe stand, and public restrooms. However on if you continue straight you'll find yourself heading to the steps that begin ascending toward the huge bridge that let's you take in the beautiful view, and feel of the waterfall. The hike is perfect for people of all ages, as it was relatively easy to climb the steps. The real challenge begins when you begin climbing up toward the top of Multnomah Falls. My experience was pleasant, except for when my phone fell into the river and I had the bright idea to go and get it, the water although fresh was extremely cold (that's a given) but good news is I retrieved the phone. Overall, my experience was a very pleasant one and I'd highly recommend multnomah falls to anyone looking for a quick escape.</p>
