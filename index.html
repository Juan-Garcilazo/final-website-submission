      <h2>Building a Secure, Scalable Cybersecurity Training Platform</h2>
      <p>A digital environment that educates, protects, and evolves</p>

      <h2>Project Overview: Cybersecurity Training Portal</h2>
      <p>
        This project outlines a web-based cybersecurity training portal built for employees across departments in medium to large organizations. The system delivers short, engaging training modules that teach users how to avoid common threats like phishing scams, weak passwords, and insecure browsing practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        The platform uses role-based learning paths tailored to departments such as HR, finance, and IT. Progress tracking, automated reminders, and interactive quizzes help reinforce key lessons. The goal is to create a secure, scalable environment where employees improve digital habits without feeling overwhelmed.
      </p>

      <h2>Systems Design, Engineering & Organization</h2>
      <img src="images/system-design.jpg" alt="System design diagram" />
      <p>
        The architecture is built with modular services: user authentication, content delivery, and analytics each run independently. This keeps the platform easy to maintain and scale. Infrastructure as code ensures that test and production environments match, reducing errors during updates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Monitoring tools track uptime, usage, and bottlenecks. If one module fails, others stay online. A DevOps pipeline automatically builds, tests, and deploys new versions, keeping updates frequent and safe. Small, focused teams own each module, from development through long-term maintenance.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="content" class="section">
      <h2>Content & Information Architecture</h2>
      <img src="images/information-architecture.jpg" alt="Information architecture illustration" />
      <p>
        Clear information architecture keeps users engaged and confident. Courses are grouped by role and difficulty. New content is tagged with metadata so filters and search tools quickly find what users need.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key actions—starting a course, resuming progress, or viewing scores—are always one click away. Pages follow a consistent pattern so employees know where to look, even when topics vary. Regular audits remove outdated content and make room for updated material.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="ux" class="section">
      <h2>User Experience & Visual Design</h2>
      <img src="images/ux-design.jpg" alt="UX wireframe sketch" />
      <p>
        The platform is designed to feel simple from day one. First-time users can sign in, see their assigned courses, and start learning in under a minute. Interfaces are mobile-friendly, with readable fonts and touch-friendly buttons.
      </p>
      <p>
        High-contrast color schemes support low-vision users. Icons, progress bars, and clear labels make navigation feel natural. Before major updates, users test prototypes and give feedback to improve clarity and usability.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="security" class="section">
      <h2>Security & Ethics</h2>
      <img src="images/security.jpg" alt="Security shield graphic" />
      <p>
        Security and ethics are core to the platform. All accounts use strong, encrypted authentication. Sensitive data like quiz scores and training progress are stored securely, never shared, and automatically deleted after a retention period.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users are only tracked for completion metrics—never behavior beyond what’s necessary for learning. All tracking is transparent. Features are reviewed with one question in mind: <em>Would users feel comfortable if they saw how this works?</em> If not, it doesn’t ship.
      </p>
